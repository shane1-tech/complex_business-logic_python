# Hi, I'm Clinton | Senior Data Scientist & AI Trainer 🤖

Dedicated to bridging the gap between **complex business logic** and **Generative AI reasoning**. I specialize in creating deterministic, high-computational Python workflows and fine-tuning LLM reasoning chains.

### 🛠 Technical Expertise
- **Core Stack:** Python (Expert), SQL (Advanced), R.
- **DS Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scipy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **GenAI/LLM:** LangChain, RAG, Prompt Engineering, Vector DBs (Chroma/Pinecone).
- **Domain Focus:** [e.g., Financial Modeling, Healthcare Analytics, Supply Chain Optimization].

### 🎯 Mindrift-Specific Focus
- **Deterministic Modeling:** 100% reproducible notebooks with fixed seeds and unit testing.
- **Reasoning Chains:** Designing end-to-end pipelines from raw data ingestion to predictive deployment.
- **Advanced Statistics:** Expertise in hypothesis testing, Yeo-Johnson transforms, and causal inference.
